# Book Me!
Book recommendation app using Flask. I had a class with React, but I'd like to learn Flask because I want to understand the MVC model and CRUD operations better and I'm more familiar with Python. I also love to read, so having book recommendations is always welcome!
 
 # About
This very simple app uses Flask to implement CRUD operations with SQLite. A user can suggest a book and save it, and the app will add it to the SQLite DB, after which it populates the table of recommended books with the new book. Users can also edit books (and in this version, edit any and all books they want to!). Delete works the same way.
